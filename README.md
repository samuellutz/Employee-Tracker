# Employee-Tracker

A node use application for adding, viewing, and making adjustments to a business using mysql and node.


### Prerequisites

1. mySql
2. node


### Installing

To install this application, first, branch the Github Repo and clone the repo to your local machine. Then, you will need to install the node dependencies which can be done by running the npm install command in your terminal/bash shell.

After the dependencies have been installed, you will need to populate your MySQL database. This can be done with dummy data that is found in the sqlFiles folder. There are two files for this. First the db.sql which will create the database and the three tables for employee, role, and department. Second, there is a seed.sql file which will populate the database with data for each table.

After populating the data, you will need to add your MySQL password to the server.js file to ensure that the connection to the database can be made and requests for actions can be pushed to the database.

Once this has been completed, you are ready to use the application!
